# cleanHello

'Hello world' app using CLEAN architecture concept I heard about from Uncle Bob (Martin).

This creates an Interactor and Presenter class for each view.
This moves all logic out of the ViewController.
Ensure's all classes have compile time dependency but not run-time.
This ensure's 100% testability without using UI Tests.
